## Playing the game

The goal of the game is to make the player cross all the way to the top to the water.

The player can be moved around by using the four-arrow keys to move him left, right, top or bottom.

There will be enemy bugs going from left to right at varying speeds in each of the stone rows.

If the player collides with any of the enemies, he will get reset to the grass row at the bottom.

If the player successfully reaches the water row on top, the game is won.
